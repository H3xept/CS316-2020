        CS316

          FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING
-}

















{- In this course, you will:

     - Learn more about Functional Programming (in Haskell)



   (Typed) Functional Programming is

     - Defining Datatypes To Represent Problems

     - Defining Functions To Create New Data From Old

   a.k.a "Value-oriented" programming.

   A "Functional Programming Language" is a programming language that
   is designed to make it easy to use Functional Programming ideas. -}









{- We use Haskell as an example Functional Programming Language.

     - Many languages now include ideas originally from Functional Programming.

        - Functions as values (a.k.a "lambdas")

        - Immutability

        - Expressive Types

        - Errors as data, instead of Exceptions

        - No 'null' (the "Billion dollar mistake")

        - Close tracking of possible "side effects"

   Haskell is not perfect (I will grumble about it during the course
   [*]), but it does offer a place to learn about Functional
   Programming concepts without too many distractions.

   [*] "There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people
       complain about and the ones nobody uses.”  ― Bjarne Stroustrup,
       The C++ Programming Language
-}


{- Course arrangements:

   - All online

   - Video lectures will "live" coding

   - Online lecture notes in a GitHub repository

   - Tutorial sessions to go through tutorial questions

-}














{- YOU WILL NEED A WORKING HASKELL INSTALLATION

   - Suggested setup:

       - Stack + VSCode + Haskell extension

       - I will use Emacs in the videos.

   - There are instructions on MyPlace

   - I (unfortunately) cannot test on Windows 10, so I will need the
     class's help to iron out Windows problems.

-}







{- Assessment:

   - All coursework

   - Three courseworks. See deadlines on MyPlace.

   - I am late in getting the first course work out :(

     I will adjust the deadline accordingly.
