# CS316 “Functional Programming”

Welcome to the source code repository for the University of
Strathclyde CS316 “Functional Programming” course.

This is a course designed to teach Haskell to undergraduate
students. The written course materials are available from this
repository. Video lectures and access to the Mattermost forum for this
course are available to Strathclyde students via MyPlace.

## Building this repository

The code in this repository is structured as a
[stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) project.

FIXME: how to install stack and build the notes.

## Lecture Notes

The lecture notes for this course are intended to accompany the video
lectures, and provide mostly the same information in a searchable and
less linear format that is less bandwidth hungry.

The notes are Haskell files with interleaved code and commentary. You
are encouraged to experiment by loading these files into `ghci` and
editing them. Each section in the files has a few tutorial questions
that we will go through in the tutorial sessions.

- [Week 1](lecture-notes/Week01.hs) : Data and Functions
- [Week 2](lecture-notes/Week02.hs) : Solving Problems by Recursion
- [Week 3](lecture-notes/Week03.hs) : Higher Order Functions
- [Week 4](lecture-notes/Week04.hs) : Patterns of Recursion
- [Week 5](lecture-notes/Week05.hs) : Classes of Types
- [Week 6](lecture-notes/Week06.hs) : Simulating Side Effects
- [Week 7](lecture-notes/Week07.hs) : Monads
- [Week 8](lecture-notes/Week08.hs) : Parser Combinators
- [Week 9](lecture-notes/Week09.hs) : Real side effects
- [Week 10](lecture-notes/Week10.hs) : Infinite Data and Processes
